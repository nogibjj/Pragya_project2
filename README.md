This is a repo to perform bash scripting on a dataset to calculate the total emissions and to push it through Docker Hub.
Bash scripting is a series of commands written in a file and is very useful for data nalysis tools that need to be performed quite often. Bash is a type of interpreter that processes shell commands.

## Goal of the project is to: 
1. Perform data analysis using bash script
2. Push it through Docker Hub

Docker Hub is a hosted repository service provided by Docker for finding and sharing container images with your team.A Docker image is a file used to execute code in a Docker container. Docker images act as a set of instructions to build a Docker container, like a template. Docker images also act as the starting point when using Docker. An image is comparable to a snapshot in virtual machine (VM) environments.
